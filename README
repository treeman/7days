## Fast prototyping framework.

This is my collection of stuff I've needed when making my 2D game prototypes.

Dependencies:
    SFML    (openal, sndfile, freetype maybe something else?)
    boost   (linking to boost_iostreams)
    lua

License:
    None, do what you want with it.

Todo/Ideas:
    Versioning and numbering inside

    Makefile
        Install/Remove

    More examples to showcase:
        Pixelated style
        Isometric tiles and stuff with that
        Square tiled with objects moving around there
        Lazy drawing

    Go through whole codebase and find stuff to refactor/change
        Console is huge and not commented enough
            + We should be able to make some gui elements out of it or something

        Graphics isVisible not working
            + Changed it, test if it's working

        Is PixFont used inside Pix graphics style?
            Maybe make a subfolder for Pix graphics style?
            Comment a bit more?
            What does PixMap do? Why do we need it?
            Might want to find a faster way of drawing pixmap

        How does Settings work? Why do we need it? Comment a bit better
            * Made a small comment on top, might want to comment functions a bit more

        We don't have any animation sprite?
            We only use sf::Sprite? Check how it works, and can we do something better?

        Does VisualDebug work?
            Make examples of all functionality!
