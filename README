## Fast prototyping framework.

This is my collection of stuff I've needed when making my 2D game prototypes.

Dependencies:
    SFML    (openal, sndfile, freetype maybe something else?)
    boost   (linking to boost_iostreams)
    lua

License:
    None, do what you want with it.

Todo/Ideas:
    Versioning and numbering inside

    Makefile
        Install/Remove

    More examples to showcase:
        Pixelated style
        Isometric tiles and stuff with that
        Square tiled with objects moving around there
        Lazy drawing

    Go through whole codebase and find stuff to refactor/change
        Console is huge and not commented enough
            + We should be able to make some gui elements out of it or something

        Graphics isVisible not working
            + Changed it, test if it's working

        Is PixFont used inside Pix graphics style?
            Maybe make a subfolder for Pix graphics style?
            Comment a bit more?
            What does PixMap do? Why do we need it?
            Might want to find a faster way of drawing pixmap

        How does Settings work? Why do we need it? Comment a bit better
            * Made a small comment on top, might want to comment functions a bit more

        We don't have any animation sprite?
            We only use sf::Sprite? Check how it works, and can we do something better?

        Does VisualDebug work?
            Make examples of all functionality!

    From LD22:
        Countdown Timer bool when done instead of manually doing

        Game shouldn't load tweaks, we should have to do it.

        Angle between vectors
        () operator for easy changing

        Setting to turn off VisualDebug

        Need to have movement here

        BoundingBox conversion for sprites
        Animationsprites
        Easier way for setting transparency value for sprites

        Indexed sprites
        Sprite chunks, all same size and in the same file refer to by index

        Shorten GetWindowWidth to WindowWidth? or WINDOW_WIDTH macro

        Need printf function for VisualDebug as well!!!

        Draw outline for rectangles

        Need a place to call Play( sf::Sound ) so we can disgard our copy directly but it'll still be playing
        useful with ShuffleBag

        Tree::DrawBar( pos, colors.. )
        Tree::DrawRect( ... instead of Tree::Draw( sf::Shape::Rectangle( ...

        Butler create sprite out of tileset, width/height and index!

        Align Center sf::String

        Shortand for Tweaks getnum? like MAGICNUM( "bla" ) or whatever?

        Generate surrounding vectors...

        Shorten sprites.lua. Should be doable in lua... Learn more lua!!

        Fetch subsprites from image to a list
            Wanted to place in shufflebag but the same

        Investigate assertions

        Random producer of weighted numbers

        Tree::Exit() shortcut

        Generic fader fade to black or from or similar

        Versioning so we can show which version we're linking to

        Examples should have release generation tools (bundle bin + README into tar)
