* Install/Remove in Makefile

* More examples
    * Pixelated style
    * Isometric tiling
    * Squared tiling
    * Lazy drawing

* Add in gridhandling
    Subfolders/Namespace
    Includes movement and selections in grids
    * Isometric
    * Squared

* Simple GUI elements & handling
    * Text input
    * Scrolldown list
    * Buttons/Selectors

* Console
    * Is huge and not commented enough
    * Make GUI elements from parts

* Pix
    * Make Pix namespace
    * Comment more
    * Need a faster way to draw pixmap, maybe opengl bunch up rectangles to draw

* Rect
    Is this really needed? Why duplicate?
    * Check corresponding sf::IntRect or similar.
    Might be simpler with direct access to members but eh?

* Sprites
    * Animationsprite
    * BoundingBox conversion for sprites
    * Shorten sprites.lua
        Might be doable in lua?

* Vector
    * Make it immutable??
        Pros: Safer code
        Cons: Mutable might be faster to prototype

* Graphics
    * Draw outline of rectangle
    * Align center sf::String
    * Generic in/out fader
    * isVisible Check if working?
    * Lazy Drawing
        * Test if working
        * Own namespace
        * Examples

* Sound
    * Store and play an sf::Sound, store a copy and do it so we can discard it after
    * Make a Tree::Play which plays a sf::Sound or a string to a sound file
    * Take sound level settings as arguments

* Tools
    * (Bundle bin + README) to tar/zip
    * Create new project

* WeightBag
    * Modify weights for numbers
    * Remove specific weights/values?
    * If slow optimize to binary search when Get
