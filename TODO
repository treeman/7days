* Install/Remove in Makefile

* More examples
    * Pixelated style
    * Isometric tiling
    * Squared tiling
    * Lazy drawing
    * VisualDebug
    * Timers
    * Logging

* Add in gridhandling
    Subfolders/Namespace
    Includes movement and selections in grids
    * Isometric
    * Squared

* Simple GUI elements & handling
    * Text input
    * Scrolldown list
    * Buttons/Selectors

* Console
    * Is huge and not commented enough
    * Make GUI elements from parts

* Pix
    * Make Pix namespace
    * Comment more
    * Need a faster way to draw pixmap, maybe opengl bunch up rectangles to draw

DONE * Settings
    DONE * Better commenting

* Rect
    Is this really needed? Why duplicate?
    * Check corresponding sf::IntRect or similar.
    Might be simpler with direct access to members but eh?

* Sprites
    * Animationsprite
    * BoundingBox conversion for sprites
    * Easier way for setting transparency value for sprites
    * Indexed sprites
        Ability to use TileSets or similar
        Create a sprite from a with/height and index in Butler
    * Shorten sprites.lua
        Might be doable in lua?

DONE * Countdown Timer
    Timer but check wheter finished

DONE * Game shouldn't load tweaks, we should manually do it

DONE * Vector
    DONE * Find angle between two vectors
    DONE * () operator for easy changing
    DONE * Generate surrounding vectors

        - * -       * * *
        * X *  and  * X *
        - * -       * * *

        in a list

DONE * VisualDebug
    DONE * Setting to turn it off
    DONE * printf like
    DONE * Examples
    DONE * Test if working

* Graphics
    * Draw outline of rectangle
    * DrawBar( pos, colors, box ) draw a statusbar
    DONE * DrawRect shorthand for Tree::Draw( sf::Shape::Rectangle ...
    * Align center sf::String
    * Generic in/out fader
    * isVisible Check if working?
    * Lazy Drawing
        * Test if working
        * Own namespace
        * Examples

* Placeholder mouse cursor

DONE * Shortened/Simplified
    DONE * WINDOW_WIDTH
    DONE * MAGIC_NUM for TWEAKS->GetNum ?
    DONE * Tree::Exit
    DONE * VisualDebug

* Sound
    * Store and play an sf::Sound, store a copy and do it so we can discard it after
    * Make a Tree::Play which plays a sf::Sound or a string to a sound file
    * Take sound level settings as arguments

* Investigate assertions
    Boost assert looks promising

* Versioning
    DONE * Ability to demand at least version X from users
    * Tag in git

* Release generation tools
    * (Bundle bin + README) to tar/zip
    * Tag new versioning releases
        Create new libs to store?
        Modify Version.hpp
        Tag as new release in git

* Math
    * Break out to .cpp Maybe not?! Lot's of template functions which won't work
    * Utility functions for vector? clip max length?

* WeightBag
    DONE * Produce selection out of weighted numbers
        ex: r(hej -> 0.3, då -> 0.7)
        will give a 30% chance of 'hej' and 70% of 'då'
        r(a -> 0.4, b -> 0.4)
        give 50% chance either way
    * Modify weights for numbers
    * Remove specific weights/values?
    * If slow optimize to binary search when Get
