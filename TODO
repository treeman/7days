* Install/Remove in Makefile

* More examples
    * Pixelated style
    * Isometric tiling
    * Squared tiling
    * Lazy drawing
    * VisualDebug

* Add in gridhandling
    Subfolders/Namespace
    Includes movement and selections in grids
    * Isometric
    * Squared

* Simple GUI elements & handling

* Console
    * Is huge and not commented enough
    * Make GUI elements from parts

    * Comment more
    * Need a faster way to draw pixmap, maybe opengl bunch up rectangles to draw

* Settings
    * Better commenting

* Sprites
    * Animationsprite
    * BoundingBox conversion for sprites
    * Easier way for setting transparency value for sprites
    * Indexed sprites
        Ability to use TileSets or similar
        Create a sprite from a with/height and index in Butler
    * Shorten sprites.lua
        Might be doable in lua?

* Countdown Timer
    Timer but check wheter finished

* Game shouldn't load tweaks, we should manually do it

* Vector
    * Find angle between two vectors
    * () operator for easy changing
    * Generate surrounding vectors

        - * -       * * *

    * Examples
    * Test if working

    * Align center sf::String
    * Generic in/out fader
    * isVisible Check if working?

* Shortened/Simplified
    * WINDOW_WIDTH
    * MAGIC_NUM for TWEAKS->GetNum ?
    * Tree::Exit

* Sound
    * Store and play an sf::Sound, store a copy and do it so we can discard it after

* Investigate assertions

* Random
    * Produce selection out of weighted numbers
        ex: r(hej -> 0.3, då -> 0.7)
        will give a 30% chance of 'hej' and 70% of 'då'
